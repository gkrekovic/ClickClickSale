# ClickClickSale
Marketing is a sea of numbers and metrics, but it also has its gentle side. "Click Click Sale" is an audiovisual piece that explores the obscure phenomenology of online advertising together with its reliance on people, needs, dynamisms, and communication patterns that have come to symbolize something entirely inhuman, manipulative, and belligerent. The piece relies on data sonification and visualization to expose beauty and emerging aesthetics in data collected by online advertising systems, discovering their inherent social and socially connected layers. Without contextualizing or interpreting the data at hand, "Click Click Sale" strives towards precise representation of abstract marketing data in their full substantiality and multidimensionality, disclosing all the grandiosity and impressiveness of a large data set.

This repository contains Matlab code of the sonification process. Raw clicks and conversion exported from an affiliate tracking platofrm should be provided in CSV files. Data uploaded in this directory are not real data used to produce the audiovisual piece, but only examples of how these files should be structured. In order to start the sonification process, run the file called `main.m`.
